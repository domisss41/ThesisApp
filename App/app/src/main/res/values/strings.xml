        PET is one of the most commonly used plastics in consumer products, and is found in most water and pop bottles, and some packaging.
        It is intended for single use applications; repeated use increases the risk of leaching and bacterial growth.
        PET plastic is difficult to decontaminate, and proper cleaning requires harmful chemicals.
        Polyethylene terephthalates may leach carcinogens.
        PET plastic is recyclable and about 25% of PET bottles in the US today are recycled.
        The plastic is crushed and then shredded into small flakes which are then reprocessed to make new PET bottles, or spun into polyester fiber.
        This recycled fiber is used to make textiles such as fleece garments, carpets, stuffing for pillows and life jackets, and similar products.
        Products made of #1 (PET) plastic should be recycled but not reused.
        To use less PET plastic, consider switching to reusable beverage containers and replacing disposable food packaging with reusable alternatives.
